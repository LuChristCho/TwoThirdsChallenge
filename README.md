# Guess 2/3 of the Average Game

A Flask-based web application for playing the "Guess 2/3 of the Average" game.

## Features
- Users can submit their guesses (between 1 and 100).
- Results are stored in an SQLite database.
- Developers can view the final results by entering a password.
- Visualized guess distribution using matplotlib.

## About the Project

This website was created as part of a presentation on **Game Theory**. The goal was to increase interaction with students during the presentation and make the session more engaging. To encourage participation, I added a **prize for the winner**, motivating everyone to join the game and guess 2/3 of the average.

The project is built using **Flask** for the backend, **SQLite** for storing guesses, and **matplotlib** for visualizing the results. Itâ€™s a fun and interactive way to explore game theory concepts!
